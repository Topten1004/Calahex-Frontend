      and Latin America Hybrid Exchange (Calahex)</b> which is developed, provided and owned by
      Kamermans Holding, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Aruba. When this

      <h4>4. Calahex services</h4>
      <h4 className = "tab1">4.1</h4> <p className = "tab1">The Calahex platform will permit you to place buy and sell orders of, and facilitate the
      settlement of transactions relating to the purchase and sale of, Digital Assets, including
      Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptos or digital assets authorized by us to be traded on our

      Submitted token listings are reviewed by us and either approved or rejected in our sole
      discretion.</p>
      <h4>5. Account registration and identity verification</h4>
      <p>Current, complete and accurate information is required on the registration page. You agree to
      provide us with the correct information on a continued basis. You are the only person
      authorized to use your account and you are not allowed to share your account credentials with
      any other person. You permit us to keep a record of this information and allow us to make
      direct or third party inquiries to verify your identity or to protect you and other users, and/or us
      against fraud or other financial crime, and take the necessary action based on the results of
      such inquiries. You fully understand and agree that when we carry out these inquiries your
      personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial
      crime agencies. You warrant that any and all information provided to us pursuant to this
      Agreement or otherwise is true, accurate and not misleading in any respect. If any such
      information changes, it is your obligation to update such information as soon as possible.
      Failure to do so may result in the suspension of your ability to use the services or the closure of
      your account.</p>
      <h4>6. Third party transfers</h4>
      <p>Calahex users may purchase Digital Assets directly using fiat currency through Simplex, Pay
      Pall and Payoneer. You can send purchased Digital Assets to the designated address provided
      by Calahex and wait for the balance to appear in your Account. Alternatively, if you already
      own Digital Assets, you may send Digital Assets you already own to the designated address
      provided by Calahex and wait for the balance to appear in your Account. It is your
      responsibility to ensure you send the Digital Assets to the correct address provided for that
      specific Digital Asset, otherwise your funds may never be recovered. You understand,
      acknowledge and fully agree that certain Digital Assets require a minimum amount of deposits.
      Sending a Digital Asset to a Calahex address that cannot receive that specific Digital Asset, or
      if you a make a mistake, like a wrong typo or wallet address, such Digital Asset may be lost
      forever. Lost of Digital Asset can also occur if you send a Digital Asset from your Calahex
      account to an external address that does not correspond to that exact Digital Asset. You
      therefore will accept all responsibility for any losses that are incurred as a result of sending a
      Digital Asset to an incorrect or non-compatible wallet address. In addition Calahex does not
      guarantee or issue any warranties regarding the length of time it may be required to process a
      transfer of your Digital Asset from a third party wallet or other source to your account or ‘vice
      versa’. The possibility remains that in case you transfer Digital Assets from your account to a
      third party that the new location may reject your transfer due to technical difficulties or other
      issues effecting our platform. You fully agree that you shall not hold Calahex liable for any
      damages arising from a rejected transfer.</p>

      communication. Email links claiming to be from Calahex requesting you to give your password
      are not from our platform and should never be opened or clicked on for they are likely to be
      fraudulent.</p>
      <p className = "tab1">You may fund your account at Calahex with Digital Assets transferred from third party accounts.
      We do not charge for deposits but third parties may charge transaction and other fees. Digital
      Assets in this case will be transferred to our main Calahex account and credited to your
      account. You are allowed to withdraw part or all of the Digital Assets under your name
      recorded on the Calahex ledger. Withdrawals may take up to three (3) days to complete and
      may be delayed as necessary to comply with relevant KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML
      (Anti Money Laundering) policies. Your electronic statements, including balance, order history,
      deposits, withdrawals and transactions are available for viewing anytime. You agree that
      sometimes errors may occur that not influence the actual results of a given transaction. Any
      transaction listed in the statement or other communication including, but not limited to, receipts
      sent to your email address on record shall be deemed and treated as authorized and correct,
      approved, and confirmed by you unless we receive a written notice from you to the contrary

      <h4 className = "tab1">8.3 Orders</h4>
      <p className = "tab1">You full understand and agree that your are bound by any orders you place through our
      platform. You agree that you are fully responsible for the maintenance of your passwords and
      security codes and any unauthorized access to your account. This also includes the passwords
      and the security codes of your authorized person(s). In case of theft of your passwords, and/or
      security codes, you agree to report this immediately to us. It is not our duty to verify whether
      any order has been authorized by you or other authorized person(s) and therefore we cannot
      be held liable for any theft of passwords and security codes of you or your authorized
      person(s).</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">8.4 Trading</h4>
      <p className = "tab1">Calahex is a trading platform that allows you to place buy and sell orders and facilitates the
      settlement of the purchase or sale between users. The platform simply matches buy and sell
      orders and we do not act as a principle in or participate in those transactions. Therefore we are
      not responsible for any disputes among or between users regarding any transaction. Our
      software and models automatically pair orders and a notification is send to the user that the
      order has been executed. Order execution is instantaneously, so never place and order if you
      do not fully intend to complete the transaction. The platform offers you to modify or cancel an
      order but only before it is matched and executed. However we do not accept any responsibility
      in case you cannot modify or cancel an order. In case you cannot modify or cancel an order, or
      in case your multiple attempts in doing so result in a duplicate order, you will be bound by any
      execution of the original order and duplicate orders. You fully understand that you are
      responsible for all executions. All orders executed, thus meaning the indicated Digital Assets
      have been credited into and debited from your account, are irreversible. You agree that due to
      technical and other restrictions, the price of any Digital Asset displayed on our platform may be
      delayed and therefore may not reflect the current live market value of such Digital Asset.
      However you accept that the value of your account is the right one considering these
      circumstances. You will not hold Calahex liable for orders that may be traded ahead of yours,
      bids and offers that may be exhausted at a posted price, market makers that fail to honor their
      posted prices, automated execution systems that reroute user orders, policies, procedures or
      system delays or failures that may prevent your order from being executed or that may delay
      the execution of your order or may cause your order not to be executed at the best price.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">8.5 Transaction fees</h4>
      <p className = "tab1">In exchange for access to our platform you agree that you will pay a transaction fee for every
      transaction initiated by you as either a ‘maker’ or ‘taker’. Information about our fees are
      available on our platform. You authorize us to deduct any applicable fees from your account at
      the time you execute a transaction. We reserve the right to change, modify or increase these
      fees at any time and they will be duly posted on our platform from time to time. If you do not
      agree you may close your account. If you continue to use our platform following any updates
      on fees it will be considered the acceptance of all such changes or revisions. You agree at all

      <h4 className = "tab1">9. Liability limitations</h4>
      <p className = "tab1">You fully understand and agree that to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law that
      you hereby discharge, acquit, and otherwise release us, our parent company, subsidiaries,
      affiliates, respective officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, attorney’s, co

      or consequential damages for trading losses, loss of information, business interruption or lost

      <p className = "tab1">This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Aruba
      without regard to the conflicts of law rules in other jurisdictions. You agree and understand that
      your obligations and the obligations of each user set forth in this agreement are necessary and
      reasonable in order to protect us and the platform. You expressly agree that due to the unique

      otherwise, we shall be entitled to obtain relief against any threatened breach of this agreement
      or your continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.</p>
      <h4>10. Trading risks</h4>
      <p>There are different risks associated with Digital Assets and hereafter we are listing a couple of
      those risks but the list should not be considered all-inclusive.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.1</h4> <p className = "tab1">Calahex provides a trading only service, we do not advise our customers on whether
      any particular buy or sell order is a good one or a bad one. Any decision to buy or sell
      Digital Assets is the user’s decision only and Calahex will not be liable for any loss
      suffered.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.2</h4> <p className = "tab1">If we, or any of our representatives provide trading recommendations, market
      commentary, or any other information, we do so independently to our relationship with
      you and you will not consider that as investment or financial advice from our part and it
      should never be considered as such.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.3</h4> <p className = "tab1">You understand that trading Digital Assets is risky, and that they are very volatile and
      unpredictable when it comes to price fluctuations. You accept and agree that you will be
      solely responsible for doing your own research and investigation into the risks of any
      transaction regarding Digital Assets. You confirm that you have enough knowledge,
      market understanding, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of any
      risks associated with trading in any Digital Asset.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.4</h4> <p className = "tab1">You understand and agree that Blockchain networks can go offline as a results of bugs,
      forks, attacks, or any number of reasons. There fore our general advice to any
      customer with limited trading experience and low risk tolerance is pretty simple; do not
      engage in active trading and if you do so against our advise be sure never to trade more
      than you can afford to lose.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.5</h4> <p className = "tab1">Digital Assets can potentially loose their total value because their value is derived from
      the continued willingness of the market participants to exchange Digital Assets.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.6</h4> <p className = "tab1">Development and control over software protocols in regard to Digital Assets are beyond
      our control. Most Digital Assets are open source projects. These protocols might be
      subject to sudden and unpredicted changes that might have a significant impact on the
      availability, value and usability of a particular Digital Asset.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.7</h4> <p className = "tab1">We might suffer from unexpected surges in activity on our platform, technical difficulties
      or cyber attacks that can cause our platform to interrupt our services. You accept the
      risks involved and you agree not to hold Calahex responsible for any related losses.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.8</h4> <p className = "tab1">You are responsible to comply with all applicable laws in your territory. Calahex is not
      responsible to determine which laws may apply to your transactions and this also
      includes tax laws. You are solely responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising
      from your use of our services.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.9</h4> <p className = "tab1">The Digital Assets in your account are not protected by any insurance.</p>
      <h4 className = "tab1">10.10</h4> <p className = "tab1">Some Digital Assets are built on protocols that support staking. This means that if you
      hold these Digital Assets in your account that they carry additional risks. Calahex is not
      responsible for any losses you may suffer related to staking</p>
      <h4>11. Margin trading</h4>
      <p>This chapter only applies to you if you are permitted to engage in margin trading on our
      platform. We advise you to read chapter 1 to conclude if you as a trader can engage in margin
      trading or not. Margin trading is high risk. If you trade margin as a borrower you may sustain a
      total loss of Digital Assets or owe Digital Assets beyond what you have deposited. High
      volatility and substantial risk of none liquidity in Digital Asset markets translates in the
      possibility that you may not be able to liquidate your position. There fore you agree to maintain
      a sufficient amount of Digital Assets at all times to meet Calahex’s minimum balance
      requirements (these may be modified from time to time). If the value of your account falls below
      the minimum requirement or if Calahex concludes that your account appears to be heading
      into loan defaulting we may seize and liquidate any or all of your positions and assets on any
      balance in order to settle your debts to other users. If you account still contains insufficient
      Digital Assets after liquidation of your positions you will be held responsible for any additional
      Digital Assets owned. At the other end, if you lend Digital Asses to other users you risk the loss
      of unpaid principal if the borrower defaults on a loan and if the borrower’s account fails to
      deliver sufficient Digital Assets to cover his or her debt. We take several precautions to prevent
      users to default on loans but due to high volatility and other substantial risks Calahex cannot
      be held responsible for any default to any user. Sometimes it will be impossible to liquidate a
      position. This may happen if there is insufficient liquidity in the market or due to technical
      issues on the platform. “Stop loss” and “stop limit” orders will not necessarily limit your losses
      to the intended amounts because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such
      orders. The use of leverage can lead to large gains but it can also lead to large losses. You
      understand and claim full responsibility for engaging in margin trading and Calahex will not be
      liable for any loss or damage incurred in doing so.</p>
      <h4>12. Futures trading</h4>
      <p>This chapter only applies to you if you are permitted to engage in Futures trading on our
      platform. We advise you to read chapter 1 to conclude if you as a trader can engage in Futures
      trading or not. Futures trading is high risk. Futures trading does not reflect the price of spot
      markets in Digital Assets. The market price of leveraged Digital Assets fluctuates in response
      to the value of the Digital Asset price, supply, demand and other market factors. A 50x
      leveraged Digital Asset for instance represents the possibility of a 50x gain or loss for
      respectively a small price increase or decrease on the 50x leveraged Digital Asset if you open
      a long position (buy). A 50x leveraged Digital Asset for instance represents the possibility of a
      50x gain or loss for respectively a small price decrease or increase on the 50x leveraged
      Digital Asset if you open a short position (sell). If you engage in Futures Trading you accept and
      agree that it may be difficult or impossible to close out a position due to certain market
      conditions, high volatility and non liquidity in Digital Assets. “Stop loss” and “stop limit” orders
      will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts because market conditions may
      make it impossible to execute such orders. Futures trading is complex and carry significant
      risks. They require ongoing posting of collateral to ensure margin requirements are met.
      Futures trading can lead to large gains but it can also lead to large losses. You claim that you
      have sufficient investment knowledge, financial expertise and experience to cope with the
      additional risks that are part of Futures trading. You accept full responsibility for engaging in
      Futures trading and Calahex will not be liable for any loss incurred in doing so.</p>
      <p>We recommend that you do not engage in Margin and Futures Trading if you do not have
      sufficient knowledge. Calahex will not be responsible for any losses incurred due to the use of
      our Margin and Futures Trading services. You agree and fully understand that you will have to
      hold a sufficient amount of Digital Assets in your Calahex account to meet the margin
      requirements and that you may be required to place additional Digital Assets into your account
      to cover your position (in other words to make collateral available as margin). If you do not
      maintain a sufficient amount of Digital Assets the possibility will exist that if the market turns
      against you that a forced liquidation of Digital Assets can occur without any notification. If it
      falls below margin limits a forced liquidation will happen to cover for the margin deficiency. A
      force liquidation will be executed on the Calahex platform through an auto de-leveraging
      process.</p>

      <h4>14. Disputes</h4>
      <p>We are a Caribbean company and we go with the flow as we say. Be happy is our slogan and
      life is full of opportunities. There fore we ask you politely that if you have a dispute with us to
      contact our support team to attempt to resolve such a dispute in a nice way. If for some reason
      we cannot resolve the dispute through the Calahex support team you agree to follow a formal
      complaint process as mentioned hereafter.</p>
      <p>You will send an email to <a href="mailto:customerservice@calahex.com">customerservice@calahex.com</a> stating your formal complaint in a
      clear and precise matter. A customer service agent will review your complaint based on the
      information you have provided and the information Calahex has in her possession. Within 10
      business days of our receipt of your complaint the agent will address your complaint by
      sending you an email in which the agent will either offer to resolve your complaint in the way
      you wish it to be resolved, reject your complaint and state the reasons why or offer to resolve
      your complaint proposing an alternative solution.</p>
      <p>If we cannot resolve the dispute through this formal request than we agree that any dispute
      arising out or relating to this agreement shall be resolved through the court of first instance in
      Aruba.</p>
      <h4>15. Delisting</h4>
      <p>This is not something we like to do, but at anytime we may delist a Digital Asset in our sole
      discretion based on the following;</p>
      <ol><li>Low trade volume on the exchange (either on the CEX part or DEX part of our platform)</li>
        <li>No developer support for the project or decrease in such support.</li>
        <li>Costly upgrades to keep supporting the project.</li>
        <li>The project is facing legal issues.</li>
        <li>Project is a scam.</li>
        <li>Project is a security breach for our platform.</li></ol>
      <p>We will notify our customers if we delist and will see to it that you have ample time to withdraw
      your balance invested in such a Digital Asset. Deadlines will be send to you electronically (see
      chapter 7) but there is no guarantee that you can withdraw a delisted Digital Asset if the
      network is no longer alive. This is an example of a reason beyond our control and you agree
      that we cannot be held reliable in such as case.</p>
      <h4>16. Ownership</h4>
      <p>You confirm with this agreement that you own the Digital Assets in your account and are
